## Background

[Referential transparency](https://blog.rockthejvm.com/referential-transparency/), or the ability to safely replace a function with the value it returns, has long been one of the major selling
points of purely functional languages such as [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
and [Purescript](https://www.purescript.org/). This has been quite a boon for testing, as this implies that you cannot have some mutable state present that you modify outside of the function
manipulate the return value, or have unintended [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)) occur. There is a lot less to keep track of and wrap your mind around, 
which leads to happier programmers.

One consequence of eliminitating side effects is that you eliminate the ability for your program to do anything useful, such as interact with the outside world. Without so much
as the ability to log to a console, our programs become absolutely useless. To address this, smart programmers invented the concept of [Monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)) which
allow programmers to represent effectful computations. Unfortunately, the ability to explain what a Monad is degrades when someone actually learns what they are, so I will only try parrotting a formal definition, feel free
to skip ahead to the rest of the article if you don't want to listen to this.

The formal definition of the Monad is as follows:

We start with a functor!

### Functor

```hs
-- | Taken from pursuit.purescript.org

-- | A `Functor` is a type constructor which supports a mapping operation
-- | `map`.
-- |
-- | `map` can be used to turn functions `a -> b` into functions
-- | `f a -> f b` whose argument and return types use the type constructor `f`
-- | to represent some computational context.
-- |
-- | Instances must satisfy the following laws:
-- |
-- | - Identity: `map identity = identity`
-- | - Composition: `map (f <<< g) = map f <<< map g`
class Functor f where
  map :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

Basically, a functor denotes a type that can be mapped. For example, lists are functors and can me mapped, as
can trees.

### Apply

```hs
-- | Taken from pursuit.purescript.org

-- | The `Apply` class provides the `(<*>)` which is used to apply a function
-- | to an argument under a type constructor.
-- |
-- | `Apply` can be used to lift functions of two or more arguments to work on
-- | values wrapped with the type constructor `f`. It might also be understood
-- | in terms of the `lift2` function:
-- |
-- |
-- | lift2 :: forall f a b c. Apply f => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
-- | lift2 f a b = f <$> a <*> b
-- | 
-- |
-- | `(<*>)` is recovered from `lift2` as `lift2 ($)`. That is, `(<*>)` lifts
-- | the function application operator `($)` to arguments wrapped with the
-- | type constructor `f`.
-- |
-- | Put differently...
-- | 
-- | foo =
-- |   functionTakingNArguments <$> computationProducingArg1
-- |                            <*> computationProducingArg2
-- |                            <*> ...
-- |                            <*> computationProducingArgN
-- |
-- |
-- | Instances must satisfy the following law in addition to the `Functor`
-- | laws:
-- |
-- | - Associative composition: `(<<<) <$> f <*> g <*> h = f <*> (g <*> h)`
-- |
-- | Formally, `Apply` represents a strong lax semi-monoidal endofunctor.
class Functor f <= Apply f where
  apply :: forall a b. f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

For a type `f` to be an instance of the `Apply` typeclass, means a type `f` that contains a function `a -> b`, a type `f` that contains a statically polymorphic value `a`, that returns a type `m b`. 

### Applicative

```hs
-- | Taken from pursuit.purescript.org

-- | The `Applicative` type class extends the [`Apply`](#apply) type class
-- | with a `pure` function, which can be used to create values of type `f a`
-- | from values of type `a`.
-- |
-- | Where [`Apply`](#apply) provides the ability to lift functions of two or
-- | more arguments to functions whose arguments are wrapped using `f`, and
-- | [`Functor`](#functor) provides the ability to lift functions of one
-- | argument, `pure` can be seen as the function which lifts functions of
-- | _zero_ arguments. That is, `Applicative` functors support a lifting
-- | operation for any number of function arguments.
-- |
-- | Instances must satisfy the following laws in addition to the `Apply`
-- | laws:
-- |
-- | - Identity: `(pure identity) <*> v = v`
-- | - Composition: `pure (<<<) <*> f <*> g <*> h = f <*> (g <*> h)`
-- | - Homomorphism: `(pure f) <*> (pure x) = pure (f x)`
-- | - Interchange: `u <*> (pure y) = (pure (_ $ y)) <*> u`
class Apply f <= Applicative f where
  pure :: forall a. a -> f a
```
For a type `f` to be in the applicative typeclass, it also needs to be an instance of the
apply typeclass and have an operation `pure` where you lift some value `a` into the type `f a`. 

### Bind

```hs
-- | Taken from pursuit.purescript.org

-- |
-- | x >>= f = do y <- x
-- |              f y
-- |
-- |
-- | where the function argument of `f` is given the name `y`.
-- |
-- | Instances must satisfy the following laws in addition to the `Apply`
-- | laws:
-- |
-- | - Associativity: `(x >>= f) >>= g = x >>= (\k -> f k >>= g)`
-- | - Apply Superclass: `apply f x = f >>= \f’ -> map f’ x`
-- |
-- | Associativity tells us that we can regroup operations which use `do`
-- | notation so that we can unambiguously write, for example:
-- |
-- | 
-- | do x <- m1
-- |    y <- m2 x
-- |    m3 x y
-- |
class Apply m <= Bind m where
  bind :: forall a b. m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

Bind builds on top of applicative and basically means that we can sequence computations. Now finally...

### Monad

```hs
-- | Taken from pursuit.purescript.org

-- | The `Monad` type class combines the operations of the `Bind` and
-- | `Applicative` type classes. Therefore, `Monad` instances represent type
-- | constructors which support sequential composition, and also lifting of
-- | functions of arbitrary arity.
-- |
-- | Instances must satisfy the following laws in addition to the
-- | `Applicative` and `Bind` laws:
-- |
-- | - Left Identity: `pure x >>= f = f x`
-- | - Right Identity: `x >>= pure = x`
class (Applicative m, Bind m) <= Monad m
```

Finally we get to what a Monad is. As you can see it builds on top of `Applicative` and `Bind`. There will be a
quiz on all of these laws!
